# professional-twin

A Claude Code plugin for building and using a personal repository of your professional self.

Your "professional twin" is a structured set of Markdown files capturing who you are, what you've done, what you value, and where you're going. Once it exists, Claude can use it to help you evaluate jobs, draft tailored applications, prepare for interviews, and reflect on direction.

## What it gives you

Four skills (each also exposed as a `/` command):

- **`setup`** — Bootstraps a new twin repo with a folder structure and seeded scaffolding files. Run once per repo.
- **`interview`** — Walks you through filling in (or updating) any twin file via guided dialogue. Asks questions, reframes vague answers, challenges contradictions, then writes the result.
- **`review-job-offer`** — Given a job description, evaluates fit against your twin repo. Highlights matches, gaps, dealbreakers, and red flags. Optionally hands off to `tailor-application`.
- **`tailor-application`** — Drafts tailored application materials (cover letter, CV emphasis, answers to specific questions) using your twin repo as the source of truth.

## Install

This plugin lives in the [`c200v-marketplace`](https://github.com/manuelschurr/c200v-marketplace) Claude Code plugin marketplace. In Claude Code, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add manuelschurr/c200v-marketplace
/plugin install professional-twin@c200v-marketplace
```

The first command fetches the marketplace (Claude Code clones it under `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/` for you); the second installs this plugin from it. After that, the `setup`, `interview`, `review-job-offer`, and `tailor-application` skills (and their `/` command wrappers) are available in any Claude Code session.

To update later: `/plugin marketplace update c200v-marketplace`.

### Local development

If you want to hack on the plugin itself, clone the marketplace repo and add it as a local marketplace:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manuelschurr/c200v-marketplace.git
```

```
/plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/c200v-marketplace
/plugin install professional-twin@c200v-marketplace
```

## Usage

1. `cd` into an empty directory where you want your twin repo to live (e.g. `~/career-twin/`).
2. Run the `setup` skill (or `/setup`). It will scaffold the structure.
3. Run the `interview` skill on any of the seeded files to start filling them in. A good starting point: `core-profile/professional-identity.md`.
4. Once you have meaningful content, run `review-job-offer` against any job description.
